# Conclusion

Hardware limitations rendered it unfeasible to simulate pedestrian flows that
were comparable to real-life scenarios. As a consequence, it can be concluded
that the simulation results do not accurately reflect the university's reality.
Notwithstanding, the selected model facilitates the examination of pedestrian
behaviour in various locations across the AGH campus.

The solution prepared enables the observation of pedestrian behaviour during an
evacuation, thus facilitating the determination of optimal evacuation routes and
the avoidance of congestion and pushing. Another potential application of the
simulation is the adjustment of timetables to enhance the movement of students
between university buildings.
