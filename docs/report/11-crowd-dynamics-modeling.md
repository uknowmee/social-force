## Crowd dynamics modelling

In recent years, there has been a considerable advancement in the field of crowd
simulation models. Microscopic models have witnessed a surge in popularity,
displacing macroscopic models based on hydrodynamic principles (e.g. the Pauls
model) [@was2011modelowanie]. The adoption of microscopic models facilitates
more detailed simulations, accounting for the distinct behaviour of individual
agents.

The Social Force model is an example of such a model, proposing that pedestrian
movement can be conceptualised as being subject to ' social forces'. These
'forces' are not directly exerted by the personal environment of pedestrians,
but rather represent a measure of the intrinsic motivations of individuals to
perform certain actions (movements) [@helbing1995social]. The Social Force model
is one of the most widely used crowd simulation models, but it is not the sole
example. Other models include the Floor Field model and the Vicsek model.
